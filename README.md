A chat program is written in Python language. Request socket modules are used. Two clients can send a text to each other over the same network and play the defined voices with each other. It sends a file on the other side over TCP and UDP. After the file transfer is completed, the client uploads the incoming file to virustotal site and performs a virus scan. If there is an error when sending the file, the clients include error checking and fixing.
